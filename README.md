# CountryInfo App - Under Construction

Welcome to the README document for the **CountryInfo App**, a personal project aimed at teaching people about different countries using the FastAPI framework. Please note that the app is currently under construction, and this README provides an overview of the app's purpose, features, and functionality that will be available upon completion.

## Overview

The CountryInfo App is designed to provide users with information about various countries. It is built using the FastAPI framework and focuses on allowing users to contribute and access information related to different countries. Users will be able to add details about countries, including descriptions, information about the people, capital city, and official language.

## Features

Upon completion, the CountryInfo App will offer the following features:

1. **User Authentication**: The app will provide user authentication functionality. Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and log out. This ensures that only authorized users can access certain features and contribute data.

2. **JWT Token Generation**: The app will implement the creation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) upon successful user authentication. JWTs will be used to authenticate and authorize users when making requests to protected endpoints.

3. **Country Information Management**: Users will have the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete country information. Each country entry can include a description, details about the people, capital city, and official language.

4. **Detailed Country View**: The app will provide a detailed view of individual countries. Users can access comprehensive information about a specific country, including all the details provided during country creation.

5. **Search Functionality**: A search feature will be implemented to allow users to search for specific countries based on various criteria. This will make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for.

## Endpoints

The app's API will offer the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/token`: User authentication endpoint for generating JWT tokens.
- `POST /countries`: Create a new country entry with details.
- `GET /countries`: Retrieve a list of all countries.
- `GET /countries/{country_id}`: Get detailed information about a specific country.
- `PUT /countries/{country_id}`: Update information about a specific country.
- `DELETE /countries/{country_id}`: Delete a country entry.
- `GET /search`: Search for countries based on provided criteria.

## Getting Started

Since the app is currently under construction, there is no official release available. However, you can follow these steps to set up the development environment and explore the code:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the development server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

Please note that these instructions assume a basic familiarity with Python, FastAPI, and web development concepts.

## Conclusion

Thank you for your interest in the CountryInfo App! As this is an ongoing personal project for learning purposes, please stay tuned for updates and the official release. The goal is to create an educational and informative platform for exploring and sharing information about different countries. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.

**Note:** This README is a placeholder and will be updated as the project progresses.
