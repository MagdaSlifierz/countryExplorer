# CountryExplorer App

Welcome to the README document for the **CountryExplorer App**, a personal project aimed at teaching people about different countries using the FastAPI framework. 

## Overview

The CountryExplorer App is designed to provide users with information about various countries. It is built using the FastAPI framework and focuses on allowing users to contribute and access information related to different countries. Users will be able to add details about countries, including descriptions, information about the people, capital city, and official language.

## Features

Upon completion, the CountryExplorer App will offer the following features:

1. **User Authentication**: The app will provide user authentication functionality. Users will be able to create accounts, log in, and log out. This ensures that only authorized users can access certain features and contribute data.

2. **JWT Token Generation**: The app will implement the creation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) upon successful user authentication. JWTs will be used to authenticate and authorize users when making requests to protected endpoints.

3. **Country Information Management**: Users will have the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete country information. Each country entry can include a description, details about the people, capital city, and official language.

4. **Detailed Country View**: The app will provide a detailed view of individual countries. Users can access comprehensive information about a specific country, including all the details provided during country creation.

5. **Search Functionality**: A search feature will be implemented to allow users to search for specific countries based on various criteria. This will make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for.

## Endpoints

The app's API will offer the following endpoints:
